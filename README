Simple Pascal Compiler by Roman Kharitonov.
Done for the university course.
Homepage: http://github.com/refaim/spc

This compiler can translate simple pascal programs to assembly and build them
using FASM (http://flatassembler.net) which can create 32-bit executables
for Windows and UNIX (GCC required).

Usage: see 'python spc.py --help'
Without options compiler will create executables.

Required software:
    Python >= 2.6 and < 3.0
        http://python.org

For syntax trees you also need this:
    Graphviz >= 2.24
        http://graphviz.org
    
    pydot >= 1.0.2
        http://code.google.com/p/pydot
        http://github.com/downloads/refaim/spc/pydot-1.0.2.tar.gz
    pyparsing >= 1.5.2,
        http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com
        http://github.com/downloads/refaim/spc/pyparsing-1.5.2.zip

You also can build compiler into standalone executable for Windows or UNIX.
For that you need:
    CMake >= 2.8.0
        http://cmake.org

    PyInstaller >= 1.4
        http://pyinstaller.org
HOWTO:
    1. Install CMake and add its 'bin' directory to PATH.
    2. Install PyInstaller, configure (see readme file in downloaded package)
        and also add it to PATH (directory with Makespec.py and Build.py)
    3. Run build script (build.sh or build.bat)
    4. Now you have spc.exe (or 'spc' if non-Windows) in 'bin' in root compiler directory.
